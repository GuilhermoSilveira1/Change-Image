A project inspired by the **Change Audiobook** concept, but this time with images.  
Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the goal is to create an image viewer where users can:
- Navigate between images
- Change the currently displayed image
- Select an image to define it as the background image
- Select another image, if the user wants to

### Features
- Image navigation
- Simple, responsive design
